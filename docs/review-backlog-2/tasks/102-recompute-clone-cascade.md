# Task 102 — Recompute pipeline: remove the clone cascade

- **Priority**: P1 (performance)
- **Status**: done
- **Depends on**: none
- **Likely conflicts**: 103, 105 (same file), 107 (builds on this)

## Problem

`App::recompute_visible` (`src/ui/app.rs:502-539`) runs on every tick that saw
a discovery event, and on every search keystroke. One call currently:

1. `self.records.values().cloned().collect()` — clones **every** `Entry` out
   of the `BTreeMap` (`app.rs:503`).
2. `filter.observe_types(&records)` — allocates a `BTreeSet<String>` of types
   (`filter.rs:55-62`).
3. `filter.apply(&records)` — for a text query, calls `searchable_text()` on
   every record (a fresh `String` built from every field, `entry.rs:350-377`),
   then `.cloned()` on the survivors (`filter.rs:120-134`).
4. `count_tabs(&filtered)` — calls `browse_row_count` **three** times
   (`app.rs:700-705`). Each call buckets every record into a
   `BTreeSet<EntryGroupId>` (`entry.rs:709-715`), and each `EntryGroupId`
   clones several `String`s (`entry.rs:723-742`). All of it is discarded after
   counting.
5. `browse_groups(&filtered, browse)` — buckets **again**, cloning every
   record into its bucket (`entry.rs:683`), building the same `EntryGroupId`s a
   fourth time.
6. Per row, `matcher.matches_group` clones the whole `CommandConfig` for every
   match (`plumber/mod.rs:154`), and `distinct_targets` prepares every
   candidate into a `PreparedCommand` and scans an O(n²) `seen` vector
   (`plumber/mod.rs:215-227`).

`recompute_command_groups` (`app.rs:709-760`) is worse in the command view:
it clones every `CommandConfig` out of the engine, then clones the whole
`EntryGroup` once per matching command (`app.rs:740`).

At a few hundred services this is invisible. It is nonetheless allocation-bound
work, superlinear in a couple of places, on the interactive path — and it is
the substrate task 107 needs to be bounded.

## Goal

Cut the redundant cloning and re-bucketing without changing any observable
behaviour or any round-1 invariant. The projection the user sees, the tab
counts, selection survival, and picker reconciliation must be identical.

## Suggested approach (agent to validate against current code)

- **Count from the projection, not a third bucketing.** In the browse modes,
  `browse_groups` already produces the rows for the active tab; that tab's
  count is `rows.len()`. Only the *inactive* tabs need `browse_row_count`.
  Consider computing the active tab's count from the rows just built and
  calling `browse_row_count` only for the other three — or, better, a single
  helper that returns all four counts and the active projection from one pass
  over `filtered`.
- **Borrow instead of clone where the value outlives the call.** `filter.apply`
  and `browse_groups` both take `&[Entry]`; several of the intermediate
  `Vec<Entry>` clones exist only to satisfy ownership that a borrow would
  serve. `browse_groups` cloning records into buckets is the load-bearing one
  (rows own their instances); the two `values().cloned()` collections feeding
  it may not need to be owned.
- **`distinct_targets` O(n²)** (`plumber/mod.rs:215-227`): the `seen` list is a
  `Vec<Option<PreparedCommand>>` scanned with `.contains`. For rows with many
  candidates this is quadratic. A hash set keyed on the prepared argv+mode
  would make it linear; `PreparedCommand` is already `PartialEq`/`Eq`, so it
  needs `Hash`. Keep the *ordering* guarantee (targets in discovery order) and
  the "unpreparable candidate is kept" guarantee (`mod.rs:211-214`).
- **Command view**: avoid cloning `EntryGroup` per matching command where a
  shared reference or an index would do. This is inside the `RuleEngine`
  contract, which says `commands()` returns owned rules by design
  (`mod.rs:417-425`) — do not change that contract; reduce the *group* cloning
  in `recompute_command_groups`, not the engine's `commands()` return type.

Measure, do not guess: add a temporary bench or a `--backend fake` run under
`perf`/`valgrind --tool=dhat` if you want numbers, but the correctness bar is
the tests, not a speedup target.

## Constraints

- No change to `RuleEngine`'s public contract (ADR 0001).
- No change to any round-1 invariant: occurrence identity, grouping honesty,
  target dedup semantics, selection-survival-by-identity, tab-count-matches-list.
- `render.rs` reads `App` directly (ADR 0002); do not introduce a projected
  view type as a side effect. If a shared intermediate helps, keep it private
  to `app.rs`.

## Tests

- Existing `app.rs`, `entry.rs`, and `plumber/mod.rs` tests must stay green
  unchanged — they already pin the behaviour this task must preserve
  (`every_tab_count_matches_the_rows_that_tab_lists`,
  `selection_survives_recomputation_by_structured_row_identity`,
  `distinct_targets`-family tests).
- Add a targeted test that `distinct_targets` preserves order and keeps an
  unpreparable candidate, if the data structure changes.
- If `PreparedCommand` gains `Hash`, add a test that equal prepared commands
  hash equal.

## Definition of Done

- Redundant cloning/re-bucketing removed as above, behaviour identical.
- `distinct_targets` is no longer O(n²) in candidate count (or a note explains
  why the change was not worth it).
- Drive `scripts/drive-tui.sh` on `--backend fake` and confirm the list,
  counts, details, and pickers are unchanged.
- Completion gate green.

## Follow-up validation note (2026-07-17)

**Finding confirmed; expand the measurement and hot-path inventory.** Static
inspection supports the clone/re-bucketing diagnosis, but the report supplies
no profile or benchmark and therefore has not established that this is the
largest cost. Before and after the change, measure frame latency and
allocations with hundreds/thousands of entries, tens of rules, active search,
and command view.

Additional costs to include when sizing the implementation:

- `Entry::field` returns an owned `String`, so predicates, existence checks,
  and template resolution clone values that could be borrowed internally.
- Command view calculates full `MatchResult`s (candidate cloning, preparation,
  and deduplication) when it only needs the matching command name, then clones
  whole groups. Preserve the supported `RuleEngine` extension seam, but avoid
  discarded work through an internal or backwards-compatible query.
- `EntryGroup` aggregate getters independently rebuild logical counts, service
  types, child services, and TXT projections; some render paths request more
  than one of these for the same group.
- `terminal::text` always allocates, even when the value contains no characters
  requiring escaping. Treat this as a secondary optimisation after measurement.

Prefer a construction-atomic aggregate projection that computes related facts
once over a collection of isolated clone removals. Preserve output order and
the public `RuleEngine` contract.

## Completion Record (2026-07-17)

- Added a repeatable release workload covering 2,000 entries, 24 rules, all
  projections, command view, and active fuzzy search. Baseline: 776.871 ms for
  12 projections (64.739 ms/projection). Final: 234.750 ms total (19.562
  ms/projection), a 69.8% reduction.
- One construction-atomic browse projection now produces active rows and all
  browse-tab counts in one record walk. Removed the initial full-record clone,
  borrowed entry fields internally, compiled fuzzy queries once, shared group
  occurrence storage, and added a backwards-compatible rule-name query for the
  command view.
- `distinct_targets` now uses an order-preserving `HashSet` membership check,
  making deduplication linear in candidate count.
- Fake and live-backend TUI smoke checks and the completion gate passed.
